# file-compressor

The most recent iteration of a file compression tool created just for fun!

## Why a file compressor?

After needing to understand file and data compression for a project at my internship, 
I decided that the best way to learn these concepts would be to make a file compression script.

## Implementation

The program uses the [PIL](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) (Python Image Library) 
due to it being open-source and having many image processing capabilities for experimentation
